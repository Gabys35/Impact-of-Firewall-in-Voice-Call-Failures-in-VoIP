# Impact of Firewall in Voice Call Failures in VoIP

## Objective
The "Impact of Firewall in Voice Call Failures in VoIP" project focused on evaluating the impact of firewalls on voice call quality in Voice over IP (VoIP) systems. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, the project aimed to assess Quality of Service (QoS) for voice calls and troubleshoot voice call failures caused by firewall configurations.

### Skills Acquired
- Troubleshooting techniques for identifying and resolving network issues.
- Understanding of firewall configurations and their impact on VoIP traffic.
- Proficiency in evaluating Quality of Service (QoS) for voice calls.
- Hands-on experience with Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and analysis.

## Objective
The project aimed to evaluate the impact of firewalls on voice call quality in VoIP systems and troubleshoot voice call failures caused by firewall configurations.

## Explanation
Firewalls play a crucial role in network security by filtering and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. However, misconfigured firewalls can inadvertently block or degrade VoIP traffic, leading to voice call failures and poor call quality. This project utilized Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate VoIP networks and assess the impact of firewall configurations on QoS for voice calls.

## Skills Acquired
- Troubleshooting techniques for diagnosing voice call failures in VoIP networks.
- Understanding of firewall rules and policies governing VoIP traffic.
- Evaluation of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for voice calls, including latency, jitter, and packet loss.
- Hands-on experience with Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and analysis.
